# Background

Willie Dean, 1895 to 1945, under the tutelage of Mr Urquhart for practically the whole of his stewardship, became a character in his own right, and knew off by heart the foibles and idiosyncrasies of all Club members.

For instance, when the author (Mr Lex Bremner) entered the bar for the first time, Willie Dean, who was serving behind the counter, said, “Welcome to the Club Mr Bremner, I knew your father well, he always drank whiskey and soda, may I serve you the same Sir?”

Fittingly a plaque commemorating his 50 years of faithful service has been mounted in the bar.”

*Graaff-Reinet Advertiser, Thursday, November 18, 1982*

In the book by **Gerald Reilly** a chapter is devoted to the lesser known story about construction of the road to the Valley of Desolation. The two characters that feature in this story Willie Dean , but this time also features Alfred Arthur Kingwill, one of the best know figures in the district during this time......**Please add to the story if you know more**

## The Valley of Desolation

*The Municipality, Divisional Council her and other bodies of Graaff Reinet held a meeting at which it was decided to consider building a road to the Valley of Desolation. An action Committee was appointed. AAK was a member of this committee.*

*The Committee approached a Surveyor at Kendrew to make a rough survey and report on the possibility of such a road, and its cost. After some weeks the Surveyor reported that he had beaconed off the route to the Valley which would take off the hairpin bend west of the Van Ryneveld’s Dam, along the ridge, proceeding up the face of the mountain in a zig zag fashion to Rooi Dam. The Action Committee studied this report and decided to inspect the route before reporting to the full Committee. They found the suggested lay-out of the route would cost thousands of pounds more than Graaff Reinet could afford. This was reported to the Committee, which then decided to shelve the plan.*

***Some weeks later Willie Dean, steward at the Men’s Club, spoke to AAK about the road**. He was disappointed in the Committees decision to abandon the idea and offered to show AAK the only possible route for the road. The Town Engineer and AAK, on horses met Willie Dean at the entrance to the kloof where Deane led them up to the kloof to Rooi Dam. The area in those days was thickly covered with prickly pear.*

*AAK and Purvis, the engineer agreed that the road could be built. Before reporting to the Committee, AAK felt that a rough estimate should be made. The Engineer said that he could form no idea of the cost until a thorough survey with instruments was made. AAK made a mental survey, takin g the route in sections, each at a particular cost, and submitted this to the Engineer. Purvis would not commit himself to the estimated cost.*

*The Committee accepted AAK’s figure of the estimated cost at £1000 to Rooi Dam which proved a good guess. The total cost was just over £1000 to the Valley itself.*

*The Road Construction Committee was AAK and B Burger. They engaged 40 labourers and an overseer. Picks and shovels and barrows were the only items of equipment used. Dynamite completed the outfit.*

*When the road was fit for cars to go to Rooi Dam, it was decided to celebrate at this spot. On this occasion the Mayor, Mr Urquart, and others appealed to those present to support to Valley Road effort financially. About £800 was collected after the celebrations.*

*The road was eventually completed at a cost of just over £1000. AAK took a party of visiting Engineers to see the Valley, and they were asked what they thought the cost of the road had been. They answered £3000.*

*The road to the Valley was opened in 1930, and was proclaimed a National Monument in 193*5
