# Background

1909-1984. From the first day of his appointment, Mr Herby Arnott threw all his energy into building the reputation of the school and improving its facilities.  He was dynamic in his approach to all school problems and needs.  Into all the scholars who passed through his hands he instilled a high esprit-de-corps, pride of school, and code of behavior, thus imbuing them with the best ideals and an urge to be good citizens.  As a dedicated educator, Mr Arnott had a deep understanding of human nature, particularly of the youth, which was coupled with a keen sense of humour.  The affection and esteem in which he was held by all pupils, parents and general public is indeed proof of his unique and outstanding headmaster’s qualities.
 
# Speech Night 1964

“And my final word to you boys and girls is this:  The world is yours.  Enter upon your inheritance; build upon the foundation that is already laid; strive for the best and noblest in all spheres of human endeavour and as long as you are true and  loyal and resolute you will succeed.
Adventure beckons down the road that Union High has trained you to follow, a road that you must go on training yourself to climb – the old road, the hard road but still the only high road.  Pitfalls in plenty beset the way, but if it were otherwise where would be the adventure of life? Seek the pastures beyond the desert, the dawn beyond the sea and the light beyond the dark and your days will be full of happiness and achievement.
It is my fervent prayer that God will continue greatly to bless this school and all who enter it and may whatsoever things are pure and lovely and of good report here forever flourish and abound.
