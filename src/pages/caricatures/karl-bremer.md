Bremer was a reputable doctor at a children's hospital before returning to Cradock with his sick mother. In 1910 Bremer established himself as a physician at Cradock in the Eastern Cape and was elected to the city council. During the First World War he served as a medical doctor for the South African troops in East Africa. He was then medical inspector of schools in the Cape Town province. He was a doctor in Cape Town during the 1918 flu epidemic. In February 1919 he established himself at Graaff-Reinet as a general practitioner.

In 1911 he was chosen as a member of the Cape Provincial Council. From 1924 to 1925 and again from 1929 to 1943 he served as deputy for the Graaff-Reinet constituent. In 1943, he changed constituency and became a member of Parliament for Stellenbosch. From January 1949 till March 1951 he served on the Senate, but in 1951 he was elected as representative of Ceres constituency. In February 1951 Dr. Albert Jacobus Stals, the minister of health and social welfare in Dr. D.F. Malan's cabinet died. Bremmer succeeded him in his post as minister and stayed representative of the Ceres constituency. In the 1953 general election, he won the seat of the Vasco constituency.

Bremer became known for the attention he gave to preventative healthcare, housing and nourishment, but did not succeed to lessen the provinces' regulation over hospitals and to shift regulation to the central government. Karl Bremer was a very active politician. He was the protector of less fortunate in society and always advocated for the advancement of rural areas. He placed his attention on welfare and preventative healthcare and advocated a national medical-care.

From 1939 Bremer was a member of the Medical Council of the Union of South Africa and in 1943 he became the President of the organization. From 1933 to 1948 he served as chairman of the National Party in the Cape Colony. He retired as a physician in 1947 for health reasons. He suffered a stroke causing a temporary aphasia.

The University of Stellenbosch elected him as vice-chancellor. In 1952 the University of Witwatersrand awarded him an honorary PhD. in law. The Karl Bremer Hospital in Bellville, Western Cape carries his name since its inauguration on June 30, 1956 by Jozua François Naudé.

Retired as Minister of Health, Bremer died on July 18, 1953 at the age of 68.
